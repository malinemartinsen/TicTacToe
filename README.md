# TicTacToe

A simple, terminalbased tic tac toe game.

## Language

The TicTacToe application is written with (native) Python.

## Meaning behind the app

The meaning behind the app is to create a simple tic tac toe game that can be played with two users. The user is asked to fill in which player they want to be, and then play the game by simply filling out the placement of the character (X or O). The game will show the winner (or if it's a tie), and will ask whether or not the players want to play again.

Prospective updates
With further work on this app, an idea is to add gui application.
